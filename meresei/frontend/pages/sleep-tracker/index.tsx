      <h2>Cure</h2>

      <p>
        This article is for people who think they have a chaotic sleep schedule that doesn't fit into a standard non-24 diagnosis; or for people who suspect they have non-24, but cannot seem to figure out their circadian rhythm length.
      </p>
      <p>
        This article is called "Cure" because determining my circadian rhythm and following it religiously practically eliminated all the health problems I was getting from my non-24. There are many protocols on how to try to entrain your circadian rhythm to 24 hours, but very little information on the web on how to determine and follow your natural circadian rhythm. People end up thinking they have some chaotic variant of non-24 or a simple insomnia. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, entrainment protocols didn't work for me (and don't work for almost anyone with non-24).<br/>
        Here I describe what worked - how to determine your circadian rhythm (even if you think it's chaotic!), and how to follow it.
      </p>

      <h2>Determining Your Circadian Rhythm</h2>
      
      <p>
        Determining the length of your circadian rhythm is in no way obvious. I thought my sleep schedule was random for years (from age 16 to 27). For the first few years, I attributed it to poor discipline and "working with Americans" across time zones. In recent years, when staying awake for 30 hours became a weekly occurrence (a pretty torturous weekly occurrence), I assumed my circadian rhythm was simply chaotic.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What actually happens is that our sleep is guided by two coupled oscillators: the <strong>homeostatic component</strong> (how long since we last slept) and the <strong>circadian component</strong> (our internal biological clock). This combination is surprisingly easy to mistake for chaos.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To fall asleep, we need <em>both</em> of these chemical systems to align simultaneously. Dr. Piotr Wozniak puts it well in his book "Good Sleep, Good Learning, Good Life" (I highly recommend this book):
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
        There are two components of sleepiness that drive you to bed:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Circadian component</strong> - sleepiness comes back to us in cycles which are usually about one day long</li>
          <li><strong>Homeostatic component</strong> - sleepiness increases with the length of time we stay awake</li>
        </ul>
        Only a combination of these two components determines the optimum time for sleep. Most importantly, you should remember that even strong sleepiness resulting from the homeostatic component may not be sufficient to get good sleep if the timing goes against the greatest sleep propensity determined by the circadian component.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>How to Determine Your Circadian Rhythm</h2>
      
      <p>
        It might seem that if you had a real, non-chaotic circadian rhythm (whether 24 hours, 25 hours, or any fixed number of hours), it would be easy to discover. You would simply notice that you wake up 1, 2, or 3 hours later every day if you don't try to control it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        However, if you try to loosen control over your sleep, that pattern won't necessarily emerge clearly.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We don't notice it, but people with normal 24-hour sleep schedules <strong>control</strong> their sleep constantly. If they wake up in the middle of the night, they look outside, see that it's dark, and go back to sleep. That's control. They look at their clock, see it's 11:00 PM, and interpret their vague tiredness as "I want to sleep now, time for bed." That's control.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        People with normal schedules don't just "feel it in their bones" when to sleep - they consult their environment (clocks, sunlight) to correctly interpret what they should do regarding sleep.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Your schedule might indeed be chaotic, but keep in mind that unless you make explicit effort to follow some kind of schedule (like 24-hour people do automatically by seeing the sun and clocks), your schedule <em>will</em> appear chaotic and random. That's what two coupled oscillators tend to become unless you make some conscious effort to sync them.
      </p>

      <h2>What You Should Do</h2>

      <div className="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Determine Your Awake Hours</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Find out how many hours pass between waking up and feeling strongly tired again.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Your first task is to determine: after you've had enough sleep, how many hours does it take for you to start feeling tired? In my case, the answer is 16 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't easy to determine if your sleep schedule is chaotic. Your sleep components (circadian and homeostatic) might be wildly out of sync, and you might be waking up after only 4 hours of sleep, which leads to incorrect understanding of your natural rhythm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest approach: wait for a time when your sleep schedule seems stable for a few days, then record when you start feeling that semi-intense "ready for sleep now" feeling.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Track Your Natural Sleep Length</h3>
        <p>
          Now we know how many awake hours you have in a day (let's call that number <strong>A</strong>).<br/>Next, we need to determine how many hours of <i>sleep</i> you need naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The process:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Every day, record the time when you woke up</li>
          <li>After you wake up, set a timer - you must go to sleep in exactly <b>A</b> hours</li>
          <li>The next day, record when you woke up, and again, go to sleep in exactly <b>A</b> hours</li>
          <li>Do NOT try to control this in any way - no alarms, no forcing yourself to wake up earlier or later</li>
          <li>When you wake up, try to fall asleep again if you are <i>any</i> tired - try to get as much sleep as you naturally want</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Continue with this protocol for about a month. After 30 days, you'll have 30 records of your wake-up times. Insert them into the following form to calculate your circadian rhythm length.
        </p>
        <Chart />
      </div>

      <div className="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Create Your Personal "Sun and Moon"</h3>
        <figure> <img src={clockPic} alt="small white clock"/> <figcaption>‚òÄÔ∏è <span>My sun&moon</span> üåô</figcaption> </figure>
        <p>
          So, you found your circadian cycle length!<br/>
          You can now predict when you'll be awake and when you'll be asleep. Meresei.com's <Link to="/">calendar</Link> can draft a schedule for you for months ahead. But that's not all.<br/>
          Next step: <strong>buy a clock</strong>. This will be your sun and moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          It cannot be overstated how much stability 24-hour people get from environmental cues.<br/>
          Again - humans don't <i>naturally</i> feel what time of the day it is, we are about as bad at determining what time it is as we are at magnetoreception.<br/>
          Without any environmental cues, the best we can do is detecting our level of tiredness and alertness. However both tiredness and alertness can come from many sources. Furthermore, if you are at a "you must sleep now" time of your circadian rhythm, you might feel highly alert, and yet you, unexpectedly enough, will be able to fall asleep if you try to!
        </p>

        <p>
          Obviously, most people live on 24h, so we have strong cultural associations with certain environment cues: "sun = awake," "13:00 = time to be highly alert".<br/>
          So, whatever your real circadian time is, when you see that it's dark outside, you feel compelled to try and fall asleep.<br/>
          You need to learn to ignore those environmental cues. You need <i>your own environmental cues</i> that will be always there, telling you what time it is for <i>you</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To follow your circadian rhythm, you need your own sun and your own moon. <br/>
          I use a simple $5 countdown timer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My routine:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Every day when I wake up, I set the countdown timer to 16 hours (use your <b>A</b> hours)</li>
          <li>When the countdown nears 00:00, I go to sleep - this is a strict rule</li>
          <li>If I wake up in the middle of the night, I check the timer (it shows negative time at this point)</li>
          <li>If I've only slept 4 hours, I go back to sleep</li>
          <li>If I've slept 8-9 hours, I can wake up if I feel like it</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Result</h2>
      
      <p>
        The protocol described in this article is what's called a "free-running" sleep. There's a lot of confusion that chaotic sleep schedules are the same as free-running sleep schedules - these couldn't be more different!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Chaotic Non-24:</strong> You don't know your rhythm, so you fight against it constantly. Your two sleep systems (circadian and homeostatic) are completely out of sync.
        <br/>
        <strong>Free-running Non-24:</strong> You know your exact rhythm and follow it religiously. Your sleep systems work together predictably.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I had a chaotic sleep schedule vs. free-running schedule:

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Chaotic Non-24</th>
            <th>Free-running Non-24</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <strong>Memory:</strong> Only worked via associations and spaced-repetition. Memorizing things was very hard. Went to a psychiatrist about this, he told me it happens because I work too much.
              <aside>I created <a href="https://www.memcode.com/articles/welcome">memcode.com</a> site to counteract the memory thing. See the <i>"Memorizing is hard. Let's make everything else easy."</i> tagline on the main page?<br/>I do not find it relatable anymore, I do not relate to the tagline I wrote myself.</aside>
            </td>
            <td>
              I can remember things automatically with little conscious effort, particularly if I "think" about them before falling asleep. This sleep-induced memorisation wasn't happening when I was sleeping at incorrect-for-me circadian time.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <strong>Eyes:</strong> Were dry and the sun hurt them a lot. Went to an eye doctor - she said it's because my neck doesn't get enough blood to the head, prescribed eye drops. Eye drops barely helped.
            </td>
            <td>
              Now that I'm guaranteed to sleep every night, my eyes are <i>never</i> dry, no matter how much time I spend on a computer.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <strong>Skin:</strong> Was hurting and I couldn't sit at tables unless there was a blanket so I could place my arms on it. I thought it's normal, and other people just persevere. Mentioned this to my therapist - she said her skin literally doesn't hurt at all when she touches wood.
            </td>
            <td>
              After I started following my circadian rhythm, my skin doesn't hurt from stuff like this.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      
      <p>
        Apart from the physical improvements just mentioned, rigorous free-running has been great for my mental health. I'm never sleepy during my daytime, I'm guaranteed to fall asleep every night, I don't spend hours trying to fall asleep, and I now have something I didn't know I needed - ability to <i>plan</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I had a chaotic rhythm, I couldn't plan. I couldn't tell someone "we can meet at 2:00 PM on Monday" and be sure it wouldn't be my middle of the night. Hairdresser appointments in the middle of my night, math exams in the middle of my night, dentist visits in the middle of my night.<br/>

        Waking up in the middle of the night is something 24h people experience when they are having a flight, or when there's fire in their house - it should be a matter of emergency rather than a habitual weekly occurrence. A matter of <i>alarm</i>.<br/>

        Rigorous free-running fixed it for me, I don't wake up in the middle of my night "to go get a haircut" anymore.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'd go as far as to say that now that I've learned to rigorously free-run, Non-24 is just not a bother to me anymore. Chaotic Non-24 is a real, debilitating disability. Free-running Non-24 is borderline fun, just some extra calculations when coordinating with people. 
        Hopefully, if you manage to start following a proper, predictable free-running schedule, you won't just stop feeling like you have a disability, but end up with the kind of sleep quality most people wish they had.

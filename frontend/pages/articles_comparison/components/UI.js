        <div className="description">
          <b>Course creation:</b> fast and simple, however, there are a few irritating moments which <mark>Memrise</mark> is not planning on fixing (yes, I wrote them a few emails). Intrusive autosuggest makes the process slower, and definitions longer than about 20 characters can't be seen in their entirety.<br/>
          <b>Course learning:</b> fast and simple, but gets uncomfortable if it's something other than a word-definition task due to the absence of formatting.

        <h3>Quizlet: <span className="rating">4</span></h3>

        <div className="description">
          <b>Course creation:</b> fast and simple. No formatting available, but newlines get respected.<br/>
          <b>Course learning:</b> UI itself is not confusing, but it's not immediately clear how you should go about learning your items. If you find <mark>Quizlet</mark>'s task types inspiring - they do a great job at presenting them to you.

        <h3>Brainscape: <span className="rating">2</span></h3>

        <div className="description">
          <b>Course creation:</b> a headache, not very intuitive.<br/>
          <b>Course learning:</b> simple but rather slow, because we are expected to manually turn over the flashcard, and then rate ourselves. It can be done through keystrokes, but there is a lot of flickering on the screen that distracts you from the content of your flashcards.

        <h3>Memcode: <span className="rating">5</span></h3>

        <div className="description">
          <b>Course creation:</b> fast and simple. <mark>Memcode</mark> is made with comfortable course creation in mind. Design is minimalistic, and everything is supposed to be done through keystrokes, including formatting.<br/>
          <b>Course learning:</b> very fast, and the screen stays static during one flashcard (you can always see the task's content and your answer while you are solving it). Everything can be done through keystrokes.

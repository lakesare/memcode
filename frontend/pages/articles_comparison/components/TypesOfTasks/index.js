              Asteroid game. Expects you to type in answers quickly, <br/>so that asteroids don't destroy you.

        <div className="description">
          Unlike other apps, <mark>Memcode</mark> offers two distinct types of flashcards, which are intrinsic to each flashcard (you can't play type_1 on the type_2 card). Those are:
          <ul className="list-of-flashcard-types">
            <li>
              Classic 'Question-Answer' flashcard, but implemented without the turn-over (see Brainscape, e.g.). It lets you reflect on what you just answered.
              Self-rated.
              <img src={memcode_1_new} alt="Memcode flashcard type: Classic question-answer"/>
            </li>
            <li>
              'Insert answer inline' (or cloze-deletion) flashcard. If you type the right answer, the input will light up in green, indicating your answer is correct. If you can't recall an answer, just press ENTER, and the right answer will be revealed.
              <img src={memcode_2_new} alt="Memcode flashcard type: Automatically checked cloze-deletion flashcard"/>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <div className="description">
          <mark>Memrise</mark> and <mark>Memcode</mark> are suitable for fast learning, their interface is slick, they can be navigated via the keyboard.<br/>
          Unlike <mark>Memrise</mark>, however, <mark>Memcode</mark> has rich formatting available for flashcards, which means we have bold text, images, lists, code excerpts, and math formulas in our flashcards. These are essential if you are learning something more extensive than languages (coding, medicine, mathâ€”and even with languages, images won't hurt).<br/>
          <mark>Memrise</mark> also doesn't have cloze deletion cards, which are extremely helpful for learning foreign words in the context of the sentences they appear in.<br/>
          <mark>Quizlet</mark> on the other hand clearly attempts to gamify the learning process. It's refreshing to be able to switch the task types, but there is too much going on to be able to parse through your items at a fast pace.<br/>
          <mark>Brainscape</mark> is the only clear loser here. The process is both unfun and slow with it.

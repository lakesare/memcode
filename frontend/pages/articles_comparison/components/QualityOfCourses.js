          It has many language courses, where each flashcard has 'memes' attached to it. It helps tremendously in learning foreign languages.<br/>
          <mark>Memrise</mark> doesn't offer any flashcard formatting, so courses which need images or even simple paragraphs (so basically any technical course) are of worse quality.

        <h3>Quizlet: <span className="rating">5</span></h3>

        <div className="description">
          <mark>Quizlet</mark> has a large collection of user-created courses, many of which are very good (including technical subjects!). They are sorted by popularity, and the best ones are easy to find.

        <h3>Brainscape: <span className="rating">3</span></h3>

        <div className="description"><mark>Brainscape</mark> is proud of its collection of expert-certified courses, however, most of them require a paid subscription.<br/>
        I checked a few certified courses though, and they felt like automatically imported dictionary definitions rather than something worth memorizing.</div>

        <h3>Memcode: <span className="rating">0?</span></h3>

        <div className="description">
          There are still comparatively few courses on this site.<br/>
          But <mark>Memcode</mark> was not built with a rich course ecosystem in mind. It's meant for users who tend to create their own courses. If you want a service optimized for custom personal use - it might just be the site for you.
